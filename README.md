# Bayesian Black-Box Optimisation – Capstone Project

This repository contains my work for the Bayesian Black-Box Optimisation (BBO)
capstone challenge. The objective is to iteratively optimise multiple unknown
high-dimensional black-box functions using surrogate modelling and acquisition
functions.

## Approach
- Surrogate models (Gaussian Processes)
- Acquisition functions (PI, EI, UCB)
- Iterative optimisation under limited evaluations

## Structure
- `data/`: raw and processed observations
- `src/`: modelling and optimisation code
- `experiments/`: weekly queries and reflections

## Disclaimer
Function definitions and true optima are unknown by design.
